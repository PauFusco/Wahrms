# Physics Theory Project - Wahrms
This is a Worms-inspired game, where you control a little worm with the objective of winning against another one of your kind.

The physics for this project were made from zero, and the player has the ability to modify different values and/or coefficients with different keys. Examples for that are the gravity value and drag or friction coefficients. Players can also modify the delta time schemes used to calculate the physics, and also the methods of calculation of those physics. Collision calculation schemes can also be modified.
